            The Knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) module within Artificial Intelligence (AI) was the most challenging and exciting of the modules as it dealt with understanding how and why of the representation of knowledge so that machines can use it to solve problems. The objective of KRR is to build a model that is coupled with accuracy and efficiency.

            <p>            
            This module starts by providing hands-on explanations that has been used for generating classifications and trained modules that can be run and re-run to build automated classifiers. These can then be evaluated and deployed.
            The methodology used was <i>CRISP-DM</i> and here we reviewed it by applying the datafiles to the <i>WEKA</i> tool.
            <br />
            <br />            
            Found better understanding by implementing the processes, steps and methods with an assignment using a banking dataset that built the foundation for <i>Python, WEKA, Linux</i> and reviewing tools like <i>WEKA, IBM SPSS Modeler</i> for CRISP-DM and Azure ML Studio.
          </p>
            <p>
            The module was better understood with discussion forums and feedbacks. I strated on by adding to the forum about the <i>"Rapid evolution in AI â€“ requires processed data for Assistive Technologies (AT)".</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            Concluded the module with discussing about the various Learnings used to build AI modules. It's application and proposed solution. Added the topic about <i>"Software Engineering with supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised learnings"</i> within the discussion forums.
