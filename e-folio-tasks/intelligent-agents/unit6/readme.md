# Alice and Bob communications

Make sure that each python codes - alice.py and bob.py are run separately.
This simple code provides with an understanding about how the communications between 2 agents works using KQML and KIF.

Please note that this is for demonstration purposes only and in real examples there are more modern technologies better than KQML and KIF since these have limitations.

However, it is still not as widely used as other knowledge representation languages, such as RDF and OWL.

The availability of more modern and efficient alternatives, such as HTTP and REST, has also contributed to the decline of KQML and KIF. These protocols are simpler and more efficient than KQML, and they are supported by a wide range of existing applications.

Despite their limitations, KQML and KIF can still be useful for some applications. For example, they can be used to communicate between agents in a distributed artificial intelligence system.
